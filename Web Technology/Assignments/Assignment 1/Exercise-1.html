                        C
                        language. Array is a collection of memory elements in which data is stored sequentially, i.e., one

                        another. In other words, we can say that array stores the elements in a continuous manner. This
                        organization of data is done with the help of an array of data structures. There are also other ways
                        to
                        organize the data in memory. Let's see the different types of data structures.</td>
